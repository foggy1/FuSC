My name is Austin.  I am a former philosophy teacher and now I'm a software engineer.  Comics holds all that together.  [@AustinLanari](https://www.twitter.com/austinlanari)

For the tech savvy or the perilously curious, this blog is build with [Gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby).  I've got some previous experience with Jekyll, which I quite liked, but since I work professionally with React every day, Gatsby seemed worth a shot.
