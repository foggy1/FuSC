My name is Austin.  I am a former philosophy teacher and now I'm a software engineer.  Comics holds all that together.  [@AustinLanari](https://www.twitter.com/austinlanari)

For the tech savvy or the perilously curious, this blog is built with [Gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby). FuSC is partially me trying to build a lightweight CMS that I'm actually happy with.
