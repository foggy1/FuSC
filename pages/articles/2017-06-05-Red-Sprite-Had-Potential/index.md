_Red Sprite_ (That's _レッドスプライト_ in the big electric red kana lettering above) is a dystopic sci-fi manga by mangaka Tomohiro Yagi. It lasted just over three short months, premiering in August of last year and ending in December, spanning two volumes. Tomohiro's previously serialized title, _Iron Knight_, was similarly short-lived, reaching three volumes. _Iron Knight_ was serialized on the back of Tomohiro's Gold Future Cup entry.  

For those who don't know, _Jump_ hosts a contest (the aforemntioned Gold Future Cup) where mangakas aspiring towards serialization submit one-shots that debut in _Jump_ alongside more famous, established titles. Reader are asked in the typical _Jump_ survey whether they'd support any of these titles if they were expanded into a series. Often the "winner" is serialized; in some cases, as in was the case with _Iron Knight's_ corresponding one-shot, one of the titles that did not perform the best still gets a shot.

Watching this constant game of relegation is a little heartbreaking, but sometimes the second time is the charm.  _Black Clover_ mangaka Tabata Yuki is clearly a stunning drafstman, but it took having his Gold Future Cup winning _Hungry Joker_ petering out after six months to then come back and have such a big hit.

...

There are a lot of layers to why _Red Sprite_ works as a story right off the bat. First of all, the allegory of a certain class living humans being used as energy sources for the rest of society is still terrifying enough to punch through its own thin veil. Second, it provides a nuanced platform to give these kids their powers: the very thing that makes them valuable and exploitable is one-and-the-same with what empowers them to fight their oppressors. A nice bonus, of course, is that the fighting also happens to look fucking awesome.

Where _Red Sprite_ fell flat was the fact that it mainly emphasized the two points above and readers were either unable or unwilling in the time alotted to see beyond into the nuanced, layered world that Tomohiro was creating.  Unfortunately, the direction was most clear at the very end: Tomohiro was setting out to tell a story not only about resistance, but of some of the realest, scariest things that drive oppression. The villains were not \*scary dudes\* or \*zomg so strong\* without context. Rather, they were holdovers from a time where war was necessary for them to survive. _Red Sprite_ was setting up to tell a tale where the villains were not just a bunch of fascists harden by years of war with devastating weapons at their fingertips due to years of military innovation. In _Red Sprite_ the weapons and the people are the same.  

Both sides, good and evil, have their humanity circumscribed by horrifying technological innovations that bring in to question the very essence of their souls. For Tatsu Frampt and crew, the question of humanity is an afterthought: this is a country whose sovereign goal is merely to regather a group of childhood friends under a single banner. By contrast, the hyper-militaristic meatheads who aim to quash the young rebellion possess the very same powers, and only know how to abuse them. Their humanity is forfeit not because of the plasmarrow in their bones but rather because war has warped their sense of purpose, and wielding power for its own sake is all that makes sense anymore.

Even this take, however, is too simplistic, and Tomohiro was well aware of that. The apotheosis of his vision for the series lies in the Ash Soldier, the final villain that the crew faces before this story comes to its abrupt end. The Ash Soldier is horrifying in appearance, and perhaps even scarier in concept.

The Ash Soldier is explained to have been a weapon invented during a time when the fascist empire of Edenia was just trying to fight a war. The soldier himself appears to be nothing but his consciousness and his bones, which serve as a substratum for the ashes of fallen soldiers whose collective speed and strength he appears to inherit. 

But of course, the war is over, and all that is left is subjugation. So Blackburn, a storied Ash Soldier, sits and waits. I mean, holy shit. Just look at that. He _sits_ and _**waits**_ for a jolt of lightning to carry him down to a battle field where dozens of his compatratiots have perished, _because_ dozens of his compatriots have perished. His summoning simultaneously represents his army's failure and its triumph, since his presence means that the soldiers are more powerful in death.

Fucking WHOA.

And I still have so many questions. Does Blackburn actually _have_ a consciousness of his own? Does it really inhabit his bones or is it like, a collective consciousness like some kind of cross between a Borg and a Cylon? Does he feel pain? Does he really just... sit there, all the time... waiting?

Ultimately I understand why this series got canned: for all the intrigue and nuance loaded into this world in ways that don't immediately present themselves, what the reader _actually_ gets each chapter is a whole lot of bluster and very little payoff. Frampt continuously shows up to steal the show and does just that. Rescue missions go off without a hitch, and entire countries are saved almost instantly on his arrival. While certainly any number of these editorial decisions were made because this series never got out of the basement echelon of reader surveys, for so much conflict to be stacked up and resolved in the span of two volumes is a little overboard. 

Tomohiro, interestinly enough, spent too much time on making things happen; it sounds ridiculous, but it's true. Early chapters of _Black Clover_ fell similarly flat for me because the only thing carrying them was Tabata's incredible linework. _Promised Neverland_, which premiered the same time as _Red Sprie_ and is an absolute smash hit, is essentially the antithesis of its no-longer-serialized peers. It is heavy on the intrigue, and uses that intrigue to inch things forward issue-by-issue. When the rules are clearly laid out for the reader in an action manga, you don't have the luxury of using the first arc to explore them like in a more _Naruto-esque_ series. Tomohiro wrote himself into a corner.
