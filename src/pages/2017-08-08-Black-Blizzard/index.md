Tatsumi's thoughts about _Black Blizzard_ as a work are pretty telling.

> [B]ringing this work out as a book now is like exposing something shameful and private from my past that I'd rather keep hidden from sight.

In the quoted interview (with Adrian Tomine, featured in the back of D&Q's adaptation), Tomine quickly and gently (and correctly) rebukes Tatsumi for being too hard on his work.

But the pace at which Tatsumi put this book together (20 days!!!) often shows. _Black Blizzard_ is straight out of a noir movie that sounds like it was translated from English into Japanese and then back again. The intentionally rough linework is undercut by the lumpy shapes of the characters. Though that sort of lumpiness would come to be a signature style of Tatsumi and many of his gekiga contemporaries, little anatomy things like where a head is placed in relation to a shoulder or how a head tilts often betray Tatsumi in this book, an issue he doesn't have in his later work.

Still, it would be a mistake to talk about _Black Blizzard_ as if it "aged poorly" or was "an immature work". Taking his whole career into consideration, yes, Tatsumi was a fledgling creator here; but, he had already cranked out over dozens of full-length works by the age of 21 since he was working in the rental manga business. And that of course belies the real story here. The work was not rushed in a pejorative sense but quite literally in a business sense. This is a book that was not meant to be paid for and put on a shelf, so to see it in that form inspires certain standards that a modern reader can't divorce from just about any book they pick up

The most intersting thing about _Black Blizzard_ is that it is one of the earliest instances of a manga artist (who isn't named "Tezuka") taking cinematic elements and trying to make them work on a comics page. While the story is fine, and despite noir cliches movies at a decent clip, what makes _Black Blizzard_ stand out are images like the one you see up top of this page.

Notice the focus on the main character's expression here. Notice just how much this panel is _about_ what he is feeling, and how it is represented in various ways: his expression, the sweat drops coming off of him, the frantic lettering and what it entails if you imagine somebody at a piano, the fact that the frantic lettering penetrates the sanctity of the panel, and that pair of eight notes that is dangerously close to the panel above.
