Last summer, three titles joined the Shonen Jump lineup in quick succession:  Yamamoto Ryouhei's fan-servicey _Love Rush!_, artist/writer duo Demizu Posuka & Shirai Kaiu's cerebral thriller _Promised Neverland_, and Yagi Tomohiro's brilliant but boneheaded _Red Sprite_. 

Can you tell how I feel about each one?

Of the three titles, _Promised Neverland_ is the only one still running, and has been a smash hit, regularly placing in the top 5 titles that _Jump_ serializes every week according to reader surveys. Demizu's art, frankly, is several echelons below the Tabatas and Horikoshis of the world just pages away, who are cranking out savant-like sequences on a regular basis. Author Shirai, however, has gifted Demizu an absolutely _killer_ main plot and drafts the most suspenseful chapters of any series in Jump, save for when Oda decides to really do his thing. Demizu isn't particularly _bad_ necessarily; the color page spreads are often pleasant and monstrous images grab the reader with Demizu's subdued-yet-jaunty style. Where Demizu shines is in layering the elements of a given story beat to really drive home certain narrative choke-points in Shirai's writing.

Right (bottom on mobile): Yagi is all bluster, with half of the early chapters being this old guy yelling.</figcaption>

Almost immediately, if presented with _Promised Neverland_ and _Red Sprite_, you would be able to guess which would survive serialization, given the stark contrast between the two. Where _PN_ delays the payoff until the next chapter and incrementally delivers an increase in tension, _RS_ will stoke a conflict only to immediately resolve it in the next chapter with little indication of why the reader should return again.

Still, there are a lot of layers to why _Red Sprite_ works as a story. First of all, the allegory of a certain class living humans being used as energy sources for the rest of society is still terrifying enough to punch through its own thin veil. Second, it provides a nuanced platform to give these kids their powers: the very thing that makes them valuable and exploitable is one-and-the-same with what empowers them to fight their oppressors. A nice bonus, of course, is that Yagi gets to draw big dramatic lightning strikes in every single fight.

<figcaption>Pages like this one demonstrate Yagi might not have even fully understood what he had. Puerile classism is nowhere near as scary as the alleged hyper-pragmatism that drives the decision making of the real villains.</figcaption>
</figure>

Where _Red Sprite_ fell flat was the fact that it mainly emphasized the two points above and readers were unwilling in the time allotted to see beyond into the nuanced, layered world that Yagi was on the cusp of creating. He was setting out to tell a story not only about resistance, but of some of the scariest things that drive oppression. The villains were not \*scary dudes\* or \*zomg so strong\* without context. Rather, they were holdovers from a time where war was necessary for them to survive. _Red Sprite_ was setting up to tell a tale where the villains were not just a bunch of fascists hardened by years of war with devastating weapons at their fingertips due to years of military innovation. In _Red Sprite_ the weapons and the humans that wield them are the same.  

Both sides, good and evil, have their humanity circumscribed by horrifying technological innovations that bring in to question the very essence of their souls. For Tatsu Frampt and crew, the question of humanity is an afterthought: this is a country whose sovereign goal is merely to regather a group of childhood friends under a single banner. By contrast, the hyper-militaristic meat-heads who aim to quash the young rebellion possess the very same powers, and only know how to abuse them. Their humanity is forfeit not because of the plasmarrow in their bones but rather because war has warped their sense of purpose, and wielding power for its own sake is all that makes sense anymore.

Even this take, however, is too simplistic, and Yagi was well aware of that. The apotheosis of his vision for the series lies in the Ash Soldier, the final villain that the crew faces before this story comes to its abrupt end. The Ash Soldier is horrifying in appearance, and perhaps even scarier in concept.

The Ash Soldier is explained to have been a weapon invented during a time when the fascist empire of Edenia was just trying to fight a war. The soldier himself appears to be nothing but his consciousness and his bones, which serve as a substratum for the ashes of fallen soldiers whose collective speed and strength he appears to inherit. 

But of course, the war is over, and all that is left is subjugation. So Blackburn, a storied Ash Soldier, sits and waits. I mean, holy shit. Just look at that. He _sits_ and _waits_ for a jolt of lightning to carry him down to a battle field where dozens of his compatriots have perished, _because_ dozens of his compatriots have perished. His summoning simultaneously represents his army's failure and its triumph, since his presence means that the soldiers are more powerful in death.

Damn.

And I still have so many questions. Does Blackburn actually _have_ a consciousness of his own? Does it really inhabit his bones or is it like, a collective consciousness like some kind of cross between a Borg and a Cylon? Does he feel pain? Does he really just... sit there, all the time... waiting?

Ultimately I understand why this series got canned: for all the intrigue and nuance loaded into this world in ways that don't immediately present themselves, what the reader _actually_ gets each chapter is a whole lot of bluster and very little payoff. Frampt continuously shows up to steal the show and does just that. Rescue missions go off without a hitch, and entire countries are saved almost instantly on his arrival. While certainly any number of these editorial decisions were made because this series never got out of the basement tier of reader surveys, for so much conflict to be stacked up and resolved in the span of two volumes is a little overboard.

"_One day you will turn to ash as well._" The above page depicting Blackburn's death is the stylistic highpoint of the series; unfortunately, it comes too late. The warship juxtaposed with the sun amidst a halo of clouds plays off of Blackburn's collapsing ash figure as everything dissolves around a lone eyeball. The only reason the image doesn't play _even better_ is because Yagi frequently made use of similar shots in which the solitary warship stood dwarfed by the sky in a large, top-half panel.

It sounds weird, but Yagi spent _too_ much time on making things happen. Early chapters of _Black Clover_ fell similarly flat for me because the only thing carrying them was Tabata's incredible line-work. Still, this was Yagi's second shot at serialization after his initial Gold Future Cup performance earned him a spot in the lineup with _Iron Knight_, and I can't help but hope he gets another shot. There was a lot underneath the surface of _Red Sprite_ and not enough of it was excavated. I would love to see Yagi try again with a more mature take on a series, as he has demonstrated the capability of some pretty memorable (and conceptually disturbing!) imagery that could carry a longer series; as long as less superficial chest-puffing gets in the way.
