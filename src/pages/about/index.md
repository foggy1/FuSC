I'm <span itemprop='about'>Austin Lanari</span>. By day I'm a Software Engineer, so I thought I'd make my own site for writing about comics.

Things got out of hand pretty quick.

I got really excited about designing a simple progressive web app (add this site to your home screen and it will behave pretty similar to a native app, which is awesome), and haven't been writing about comics quite as much as I planned.  But, I'll get there.
In the mean time, I still slog through challenging, small press work and do my best to share my thoughts over on [Comics Bulletin](http://www.comicsbulletin.com)

If you want to see more bite-sized rants, [Twitter is where to find me](https://www.twitter.com/austinlanari). It's also the best way to contact me.  Now go read about some comics.

The site is in constant flux and is at all-times a work in progress. To get some insight into how it's built, the source code is [here](https://github.com/foggy1/FuSC). The main library driving everything is the very clever (but also always in flux) [Gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby).
