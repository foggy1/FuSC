I'm <span itemprop='about'>Austin Lanari</span>. At my day job, I'm making a mobile app. Here, I'm building a better comics blog with Gatsby.js and writing about a mix of work that I find challenging, frustrating, and fun.
</p>

The name of the site comes from the best song of the last decade and my nickname, Foggy. You'll find me writing about things in the medium that grab me, which usually alternate between art comics and anything Japanese.

I also write semi-frequently about ambitious indie projects at [Comics Bulletin](http://www.comicsbulletin.com), occasionally drop critical pieces at [Loser City](http://www.loser-city.com), and cut my teeth writing weekly reviews at [Comics Bastards](http://www.comicbastards.com)

If you want to see more bite-sized rants, [Twitter is where to find me](https://www.twitter.com/austinlanari). It's also the best way to contact me.
