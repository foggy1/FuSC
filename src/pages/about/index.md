<p itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/AboutPage'>
I'm <span itemprop='about'>Austin Lanari</span>. By day I'm a Software Engineer. All the front-end stuff I get to do at my job is on mobile, so Fog Up Come Comics is partially born out of missing straight-up web development.

Of course, the real origin is wanting somewhere to just... write about comics. You'll find me writing about things in the medium that grab me, which usually fall somewhere between art comics and anything Japanese.

I also write semi-frequently about ambitious indie projects at [Comics Bulletin](http://www.comicsbulletin.com), occasionally drop critical pieces at [Loser City](http://www.loser-city.com), and cut my teeth writing weekly reviews at [Comics Bastards](http://www.comicbastards.com)

To get some insight into how the site is built, the source code is [here](https://github.com/foggy1/FuSC). The main library driving everything is the very clever [Gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby). This site is fully static, meaning you hit the server, get the html and... that's it. Everything is in your browser. If you're partial to reading on mobile, I encourage you to save the website to your home screen where it will look like a proper app and even be readable offline.

If you want to see more bite-sized rants, [Twitter is where to find me](https://www.twitter.com/austinlanari). It's also the best way to contact me.
