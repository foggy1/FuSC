<p itemscope itemtype='http://schema.org/AboutPage'>
I'm <span itemprop='about'>Austin Lanari</span>. By day I'm a Software Engineer, so I thought I'd make my own site for writing about comics.
</p>

Things got out of hand pretty quick.

I got really excited about designing a simple progressive web app (add this site to your home screen and it will behave pretty similar to a native app, which is awesome), and haven't been writing about comics quite as much as I planned.  But, I'll get there.
In the mean time, I still slog through challenging, small press work and do my best to share my thoughts over on [Comics Bulletin]('http://www.comicsbulletin.com')

In the short-term, I plan on fusing this blog with writing a little more about coding. That might mean I have to change the blog's semi-official name right now (despite the fact that it's Future's world and we're all just living in it), but, it _might_ turn out alright not to have the 'fuck' word in my main website.

_Might_.

If you want to see more bite-sized rants, [Twitter is where to find me]('https://www.twitter.com/austinlanari'). It's also the best way to contact me.  Now go read about some comics.
