By day I\'m a Software Engineer, so I thought I\'d make my own site for writing about comics.\n</p>\n<p>Things got out of hand pretty quick.</p>\n<p>I got really excited about designing a simple progressive web app (add this site to your home screen and it will behave pretty similar to a native app, which is awesome), and haven’t been writing about comics quite as much as I planned.  But, I’ll get there.\nIn the mean time, I still slog through challenging, small press work and do my best to share my thoughts over on <a href="http://www.comicsbulletin.com">Comics Bulletin</a></p>\n<p>In the short-term, I plan on fusing this blog with writing a little more about coding. That might mean I have to change the blog’s semi-official name right now (despite the fact that it’s Future’s world and we’re all just living in it), but, it <em>might</em> turn out alright not to have the ‘fuck’ word in my main website.</p>\n<p><em>Might</em>.</p>\n<p>If you want to see more bite-sized rants, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/austinlanari">Twitter is where to find me</a>. It’s also the best way to contact me.  Now go read about some comics.</p>\n<p>The site is in constant flux and is at all-times a work in progress. To get some insight into how it’s built, the source code is <a href="https://github.com/foggy1/FuSC">here</a>. The main library driving everything is the very clever (but also always in flux) <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby">Gatsby.js</a>.</p>',fields:{slug:"/about/"},frontmatter:{title:"About",date:"Invalid date",indexImage:null,layout:"page",description:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/about/"}}}});
