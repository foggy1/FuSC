Her work in <em>FUM</em> is evidence of this, as are the snippets of projects on her Patreon. For Sloane, layouts are a means of juxtaposing not only story beats, but also colors and textures; and often that juxtaposing extends to the third dimension wherein the story takes on layers that often carry you between physical spaces. </p>\\n<p>(Seriously, some of the best examples of this are on <a href=\\\"https://www.patreon.com/sloane\\\">her Patreon</a>, and I’m not going to post work from there even though I’m DYING to talk about some of those pages, so check them out or be on the lookout for new work.)</p>\\n<p><em>A Hollowing</em> leans more on the metaphorical space of dream-like (mostly nightmarish) imagery to guide the reader. It is a tale of trauma, the ways in which trauma resurfaces, and the ways in which we must confront the things that hurt us to move forward and survive in some kind of imperfect union. The tale unfolds through the eyes of a young girl, the loss of her mother, and a new horse. </p>\\n<p>Told entirely in black and white, with many more “conventional” layouts than one might find in her other work, Sloane instead leans heavily on ink itself as a presence on the page, with the horse being the best example. This adds to the dreamlike effect of the gray, inkless watercolors that demarcate memories, which <em>itself</em> adds to scenes where the grays and inks meet in a collision of present and past traumas for the main character. </p>\\n<figure class='floatCenter'>\\n<img class=\\\"floatCenter\\\" style=\\\"max-height: 600px;\\\" src=\\\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/foggy1/door_wipe.png\\\" />\\n</figure>\\n<p>Above, the main character catches her father doing something you would rather not catch your father doing, and then flees to her room where she falls asleep and wakes up in a dream. The somewhat abrupt shift from running away to being in bed (particularly as juxtaposed between seeing her father through two doorways in a way that appears unsettling) captures the anxiety of being a kid seeing something you shouldn’t: it’s a whirlwind until you’re somewhere safe, and even then you’re usually caught stuck with your heart beating fast, going over what happened.

A smudge almost like a tire track, running from her father’s bedroom door in the upper right of the page, to her waking-into-a-dream consciousness in the bottom left.
