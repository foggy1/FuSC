He was setting out to tell a story not only about resistance, but of some of the scariest things that drive oppression. The villains were not *scary dudes* or *zomg so strong* without context. Rather, they were holdovers from a time where war was necessary for them to survive. <em>Red Sprite</em> was setting up to tell a tale where the villains were not just a bunch of fascists hardened by years of war with devastating weapons at their fingertips due to years of military innovation. In <em>Red Sprite</em> the weapons and the humans that wield them are the same.  </p>\\n<p>Both sides, good and evil, have their humanity circumscribed by horrifying technological innovations that bring in to question the very essence of their souls. For Tatsu Frampt and crew, the question of humanity is an afterthought: this is a country whose sovereign goal is merely to regather a group of childhood friends under a single banner. By contrast, the hyper-militaristic meat-heads who aim to quash the young rebellion possess the very same powers, and only know how to abuse them. Their humanity is forfeit not because of the plasmarrow in their bones but rather because war has warped their sense of purpose, and wielding power for its own sake is all that makes sense anymore.</p>\\n<p>Even this take, however, is too simplistic, and Yagi was well aware of that. The apotheosis of his vision for the series lies in the Ash Soldier, the final villain that the crew faces before this story comes to its abrupt end. The Ash Soldier is horrifying in appearance, and perhaps even scarier in concept. </p>\\n<div class='floatCenter' style='text-align:center;'>\\n  <img style=\\\"display: inline-block;max-height: 600px;margin: 5px;\\\" src=\\\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/foggy1/Screenshot_2017-05-18-09-17-36-01.jpeg\\\" />\\n  <img style=\\\"display: inline-block;max-height: 600px;margin: 5px;\\\" src=\\\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/foggy1/Screenshot_2017-05-18-09-17-42-01.jpeg\\\" />\\n</div>\\n<p>The Ash Soldier is explained to have been a weapon invented during a time when the fascist empire of Edenia was just trying to fight a war. The soldier himself appears to be nothing but his consciousness and his bones, which serve as a substratum for the ashes of fallen soldiers whose collective speed and strength he appears to inherit. </p>\\n<p>But of course, the war is over, and all that is left is subjugation. So Blackburn, a storied Ash Soldier, sits and waits. I mean, holy shit. Just look at that. He <em>sits</em> and <em>waits</em> for a jolt of lightning to carry him down to a battle field where dozens of his compatriots have perished, <em>because</em> dozens of his compatriots have perished. His summoning simultaneously represents his army’s failure and its triumph, since his presence means that the soldiers are more powerful in death.</p>\\n<p>Damn.</p>\\n<p>And I still have so many questions. Does Blackburn actually <em>have</em> a consciousness of his own? Does it really inhabit his bones or is it like, a collective consciousness like some kind of cross between a Borg and a Cylon? Does he feel pain? Does he really just… sit there, all the time… waiting?</p>\\n<p>Ultimately I understand why this series got canned: for all the intrigue and nuance loaded into this world in ways that don’t immediately present themselves, what the reader <em>actually</em> gets each chapter is a whole lot of bluster and very little payoff. Frampt continuously shows up to steal the show and does just that. Rescue missions go off without a hitch, and entire countries are saved almost instantly on his arrival. While certainly any number of these editorial decisions were made because this series never got out of the basement tier of reader surveys, for so much conflict to be stacked up and resolved in the span of two volumes is a little overboard.</p>\\n<figure class='floatCenter'>\\n<img style=\\\"max-height: 700px;\\\" src=\\\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/foggy1/Screenshot_2017-06-06-21-09-44-01.jpeg \\\" />\\n</figure>\\n<p>”<em>One day you will turn to ash as well.</em>” The above page depicting Blackburn’s death is the stylistic highpoint of the series; unfortunately, it comes too late. The warship juxtaposed with the sun amidst a halo of clouds plays off of Blackburn’s collapsing ash figure as everything dissolves around a lone eyeball. The only reason the image doesn’t play <em>even better</em> is because Yagi frequently made use of similar shots in which the solitary warship stood dwarfed by the sky in a large, top-half panel.</p>\\n<p>It sounds weird, but Yagi spent <em>too</em> much time on making things happen. Early chapters of <em>Black Clover</em> fell similarly flat for me because the only thing carrying them was Tabata’s incredible line-work. Still, this was Yagi’s second shot at serialization after his initial Gold Future Cup performance earned him a spot in the lineup with <em>Iron Knight</em>, and I can’t help but hope he gets another shot. There was a lot underneath the surface of <em>Red Sprite</em> and not enough of it was excavated.
