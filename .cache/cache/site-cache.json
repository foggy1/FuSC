When she reached the first hills of the\nItalic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her\nhometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the\nsubline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question\nran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a\ncopy.</p>\n<h6>Slapped cozy a that lightheartedly and far</h6>\n<p>The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it\nwould have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was\nleft from its origin would be the word “and” and the Little Blind\nText should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But\nnothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long\nuntil a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with\nLonge and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they\nabused her for their projects again and again.</p>"},{"id":"transformer-remark-markdown-ast-1bbd6190c815a43f9f23deeae8bf9eba-gatsby-remark-responsive-imagegatsby-remark-responsive-iframegatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-smartypants","value":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"This is my first post on my new fake blog!
